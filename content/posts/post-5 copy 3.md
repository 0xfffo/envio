Yaupon has been overlooked for hundreds of years by modern minds as a plant that is simply a nuisance or only used for landscaping.

What makes yaupon undesirable for others, is what makes it a wonderful plant to work with for us; it’s resilient, drought-tolerant, and grows quickly. In our area, Yaupon is often viewed as a ‘weed’.

That said, weeds are often native plants. And, in the case of yaupon, this holly provides important ecosystem services like improved water quality, biodiversity, soil health, and carbon sequestration with proper management. Plus it has historical medicinal properties - not to mention caffeine.

## Nature-Based Proposal

### Our approach:

As a decentralized organization, yaupon holly can grow where it would naturally grow. We help to facilitate this process strategically to benefit citizens in our community, who collect passive income through the sale of our yaupon tea.

As a native plant to the US, yaupon is perfectly suited to sustainably provide caffeine to all of the US and the world, as its robust growth does not demand pesticides or fertilizers. Further, yaupon holly is the US’s only native source of caffeine and has a whole list of natural medicinal properties, which are and will continue to be in demand.

Yaupon is drought & salt resistant, meaning it stands a chance in a changing climate _in addition to_ filtering run-off and offering flood resistance.

By implementing our community supplier program and providing yaupon-based rewards (passive income for citizens), we also produce a product that is grown right here in the US.

### Our strategy:

Through outreach, we connect with people in our community who have naturally-growing yaupon on their property.

Our team then creates a sustainable management plan and begins harvesting the holly. Harvested holly then goes to our processing facility, where it is produced into yaupon tea.

We sell our yaupon tea both online and in stores locally. We hold and participate in a wide range of educational events to educate the public about the many wonders of yaupon.

Beyond that, we work closely with various local non-profits and organizations, including local municipalities, to engage with and educate the public about the many benefits of yaupon holly, both for people and the environment.

### GIS Habitat Analysis Tool

Our science team is currently developing a GIS Habitat Analysis tool to better record the positive ecosystem benefits of yaupon growth, in order to better incentivize the adoption of yaupon holly management through carbon/ecological credits.

With the completion of our GIS tool and eco-credit methodology design, we will be able to directly connect with Regen Ledger and Regen Network to provide carbon and eco credits derived from our sustainable yaupon holly growth and management.

### **Community Supplier Program**

1. We work with local community members and land stewards to identify native yaupon holly growth here in the southeast
2. Once a sustainable management plan has been created with the property owner, we begin routinely harvesting. This is based on site-specific ecological indicators designed to monitor its ecological benefit and growth
3. Suppliers then receive continuous rewards based on the quantity/quality of yaupon they provide to us for sale
4. Suppliers will also receive a portion of the value of the associated ecosystem services provided through sustainable yaupon holly management (**coming soon)**

This will allow for an entire wave of new people and communities to participate and benefit from the collective regeneration of our native lands, using yaupon holly and cutting edge blockchain and satellite technology.

## Benefits

With the help of our sustainable management plans and GIS Habitat monitoring tool, we can measure:

1. Improved soil health
2. Improved biodiversity
3. Carbon sequestration
4. Fire protection
5. Increased water quality

All derived through the sustainable management of native yaupon holly growth.

Through our community supplier program and local partners, we work to incentivize community-based ecological regeneration, utilizing the many benefits of native yaupon holly growth and management.

Further, this project encourages members of our community to get familiar with their own backyards, which we believe has an unmeasurable benefit.

## Organization

We are **community-driven, meaning w**e work with a **network** of local land stewards (farmers, land managers, and landowners) to **sustainably** harvest and manage stands of yaupon holly growth.

We seek to educate the public about the many ecological, economic, and health benefits of its widespread use and re-adoption. This will be done by creating the most natural, healthy, and sustainable products possible, and through regenerative practices, community involvement, and educational workshops.

**All** profits from our tea sales are invested back into yaupon education, research, and local restoration projects. This ensures we can make the largest positive impact possible, for both people and the environment.

### Vision for Methodology Development:

Using a mixture of GIS, remote sensing, and ground-truthed data, we are working to continuously measure and analyze various ecosystem services / benefits, including water quality, soil health, vegetative health, biodiversity, carbon sequestration, and fire risk, derived from our sustainable management plans and community yaupon supplier program.

Thanks to the help of our land stewards, we have access to many acres of native yaupon holly growth, ranging from a few plants to thousands. Using our GIS tool, which will begin as a publicly viewable page / ArcGIS Online dashboard, we aim to measure and record the various ecosystem benefits listed above, turning these measurable positive impacts into associated ecosystem and carbon flex credits with the help of Regen Network and others.

While we currently provide a portion of our sales back to our community yaupon suppliers based on the quality / quantity of yaupon harvested, we aim to utilize the revenue generated from the sale of associated ecosystem credits to continuously incentivize our suppliers, based on the positive ecological benefits they provide with their yaupon holly growth!

### Current Methods for Measuring Project Benefits:

1. Increased Water Quality - Methodology TBD
2. Increased Soil Health - Sentinel 2 data + NDSI + ground truth data (soil tests)
3. Increased Vegetative health - Remotely sensed NDVI + ground truth data + antioxidant/caffeine analyses
4. Increased Ecological Biodiversity - Remotely sensed Biodiversity Index + ground truth data (point count)
5. Carbon Sequestration - Methodology TBD
6. Fire Risk - NDFI + ground truth data (soil tests)
