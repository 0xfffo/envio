Ecuador has set a national target to reach net zero carbon emissions by 2050, and increased injections of land-use based carbon funding initiatives are already planned from both national (Programa Carbono Cero) and international sources (e.g., LEAF). It is urgent to address the issue of land tenure insecurity now as increased funds in the context of prevalent institutional weaknesses and corruption will provide incentives that will aggravate the problem even further. A decentralized land registry is an essential tool for the development of ecocredit/natural assets that reduce the risk of ‘land grabbing’ and help meet both environment and development goals, including those related to equity and social justice. This is a key component of the design of ecological state protocols (ESP) to integrate with land management plans that CONDESAN will develop with support of TGI. Regen Ledger will host such projects to help access PES via decentralized agreements and transactions between investors and land stewards. Development of a pilot blockchain-based land registry for land/resource tenure security and transparency will benefit legitimate land stewards and provide verification as a safeguard for investors. In this initial phase, clear specifications for the decentralized land registry will be developed based on literature review, consultation with potential community end-users, existing non-blockchain registries, experts in Ecuador and elsewhere in Latin America, and with guidance as needed from RND. This will lay the groundwork for accelerated software development of the blockchain-based land registry in the next phase, and later to pilot its implementation with selected government entities such as the Municipality of Quito.

## Nature-Based Proposal

### Our approach:

The core team working on the project “Ecuadorian Ecosystem Regeneration Partnership: Pilot Project in the Andean Choco Biosphere Reserve” and in this component: “Land Tenure Security and Transparency”, prospectively funded by this grant from RND, are from both CONDESAN and Terra Genesis International (TGI). Lead members from CONDESAN are Manuel Peralvo and Inty Arcos; and from TGI are Robbe Verhofste and Jefferson Mecham, with other members of each respective team designated as required. In addition, a qualified software engineer will be contracted to develop clear specifications for the decentralized land registry using blockchain technology as the basis for software development in a subsequent phase.
