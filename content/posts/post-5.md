Grasslands and pastures cover approximately one quarter
of the land on Earth. Conventional cattle management has produced degradation and carbon loss on these ecosystems, whereas well managed grasslands can sequester carbon and provide a lot of co- benefits including increases in biodiversity, soil health, water holding capacity, ecosystem´s resilience and many more.
More scientifically robust and cost effective methodologies are needed to account for changes in the carbon stocks and cobenefits, to open the door for economic incentives like carbon credits for the land stewards playing a regenerative role on Earth.

## Nature-Based Proposal

### Our approach:

The CarbonPlus Grasslands credit is designed to significantly increase the amount of hectares regeneratively grazed worldwide. The methodology relies on remote sensing to substantially reduce the cost of monitoring carbon sequestration while maintaining location-based scientific rigor.

### Our strategy:

The Methodology for GHG and Co-Benefits in Grazing Systems provides a holistic assessment of ecological state indicators for grasslands under regenerative grazing practices. Managed grazing, which involves carefully controlling livestock density and intensity of grazing, has been shown to provide a wide range of ecosystem benefits such as enhanced carbon sequestration, improved soil health, and increased water infiltration.

This methodology combines remote sensing data with in-field measurements to provide high quality estimates of soil organic carbon stock and measures additional ecological co-benefits such as animal welfare, ecosystem health, and soil health.

### **Collect in-field soil samples**

Soil samples collected at strategic points across the property are tested for soil organic carbon, bulk density, and soil health variables.

### **Map soil organic carbon**

Remote sensing data and the lab-tested soil samples are used to estimate soil organic carbon at unsampled locations using statistical models, machine learning, and spatial interpolation.

### **Quantify soil organic carbon stock**

Percent soil organic carbon estimates are combined with bulk density measurements from the field to quantify soil organic carbon stocks and CO2 equivalent stocks.

### **Calculate creditable carbon change**

Creditable carbon change is calculated by comparing the measured CO2 equivalent stocks to the baseline year. Deductions are made to account for emissions from the project activity, such as methane emissions, and uncertainty from the soil carbon estimate.

### **Assess co-benefits**

Soil health, ecosystem health, and animal welfare are assessed using a combination of remote sensing and in-field data to provide a holistic assessment of the project area beyond carbon sequestration.
