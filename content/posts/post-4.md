Carbon sequestered in sediments of the coastal & open ocean is an outsize contributor to the global total, but these regions are challenging to measure regularly and directly due to complex, fast-moving sediment dynamics and difficult field conditions. High-resolution remote sensing has opened up opportunities for faster and more regular quantification, but work remains to establish standards around validating remote sensing techniques with in-situ data.

## Nature-Based Proposal

### Our approach:

In this project, we will collate literature on both field and remote sensing blue carbon techniques, focusing on balancing above-ground and below-ground biomass with soil carbon content, and construct a typology of methods with an eye to their scalability and interoperability.

This will be presented in a summarizing document which will also include an overview of the drivers and timescales of landscape change (natural and anthropogenic) in blue carbon ecosystems and a discussion of how to account for these dynamics in carbon flux and stock quantification.

The development of this document will include a _“Blue Carbon Conversation”_ event in June 2022, hosted on UC Berkeley's campus, in which members of our network will be invited to a short paid event to share perspectives and contribute to the topic of our report. The event format will be a casual exchange with semi-structured prompts and questions, and is intended to help open discovery for further research for the project report, illuminating bottlenecks and assumptions made in typical soil carbon estimates from blue carbon ecosystems.

### Our strategy:

This project seeks out the best of contemporary science to support the quantification of an ecosystem service, supporting Regen’s model to sell these and support effective stewardship. By focusing on blue carbon, we will make progress towards systems that can be more challenging in their physical mechanics than terrestrial systems, but which have enormous co-benefits. (Coastal blue carbon ecosystems can remove toxins, reduce flood risk, serve as the foundation of fisheries, and more.)

The literature review is a synthesis of existing research towards these ends, highlighting the nuanced scientific research behind blue carbon systems. The research community around blue carbon is growing, and conversations around the nuances of comparing standard soil carbon techniques (loss-on-ignition and total carbon) to those analyzing just the surface (i.e. remote sensing) are unfolding in present-day research spaces. We have the ability to connect with those conversations as necessary. Most technical difficulties will come from the open-ocean carbon questions, where field work is difficult and remote sensing does not capture the dynamics at depth, and we will explore where to draw this boundary and what steps there may be to pursue more quantification of ocean systems.

Ultimately, the goal of this report and discussion is to standardize an effective “minimum viable field work” framework to reduce the cost of stock assessment. This advice will be contextualized around the typical geologic histories of these coastal margin types with recommendations as to how credits could change over time.

### Hurdles we’re trying to overcome:

One of the most difficult topics is that of doing “enough” field work. The validation should not be a tall or difficult gatekeeper, but it should also encourage doing work that is accurate to an effective degree. Smallholders may face additional barriers by setting expectations for technical field work to be done in blue carbon environments (e.g. deploying expensive sensors underwater). Similar questions around “enough” work fall into building site-specific allometric relationships or soil carbon content regressions (to remotely sensed data). At what level of difficulty or uncertainty should we fall back on regional or global averages?

### What can the community help us with?

- References that point to regional vs. global representative metrics for carbon stock and flux rates in blue carbon environments
- Notes on the relative cost differences of different validation strategies
- Connections to blue carbon validation initiatives.

### Contributions we are excited to offer the community:

- A science-based perspective on land use change and carbon sequestration (i.e. advice on geomorphology and physical processes)
- Knowledge of coupled human-environment systems
