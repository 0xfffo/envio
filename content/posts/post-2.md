In the past decade, Cambodia’s agriculture sector growth has come mainly from the extraction and depletion of natural capital and is on an unsustainable trajectory. [Approx. 41% of all cultivated soils are medium to severely degraded.](https://www.academia.edu/38541506/State_of_Land_in_the_Mekong_Region)

This **soil degradation** due to tillage-based intensive mono-cropping and usage of agro-chemical inputs is progressing at a rapid pace with sometimes extreme environmental and social consequences. Moreover, Cambodia and the lower Mekong region is facing challenges of extreme weather patterns and is among [the ten most vulnerable regions in the world suffering from climate variability](https://www.germanwatch.org/sites/germanwatch.org/files/Global%20Climate%20Risk%20Index%202019_2.pdf).

[Conventional agriculture emits approx. 24%](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data) of all GHG emissions globally, [44% on the Asian continent](http://www.fao.org/resources/infographics/infographics-details/en/c/218650). This accelerates climate change, which in turn threatens food security through intensifying heat waves in a vicious circle of feedback loops.

In order to become sustainable, a future agricultural methodology must rely on an agroecological transition that regenerates degraded ecosystems and at the same time values, incentivizes and rewards eco-friendly practices.

## Nature-Based Proposal

### Our approach:

**_Golden Soil_** is a pilot to develop a transitioning system for farmers to implement argoecological practices. The project’s objectives are to incentivize and accelerate the adoption of regenerative practices with a transparent reward- and inexpensive MRV system. During the pilot phase we will develop methodologies and credit classes for tropical croplands and bridge the financing gap of the first 2 years based on practice change. Later, carbon sequestration and emission reductions will be quantified and result-based practice changes will be rewarded. We will also develop eco credits beyond carbon.

### Our strategy:

DEI MEAS (Golden Soil in English) is a pilot project to develop apractice-based methodology and credit classes for regenerativefarming. It is lead by the Cambodian General Department ofAgriculture (GDA), under the ASSET project, and funded by AFD,EU and FFEM.• The project is conceptualized and implemented by a consortiumformed of private sector partner SmartAgro SustainableInnovations Co., Ltd. and public partners CIRAD and Swisscontact.• Regen Network Development provides technical and financialsupport to SmartAgro for the development of the methodologyand credit classes.

## Organization

Our mission is to implement agroecological practices to add long term value to people, smallholder communities and the ecosystem in the farming industry and reward regenerative practices for a transition towards a nature-positive agriculture.

This project is carried out by a consortium financed by [Agroecology and Safe Food Systems Transition in Southeast Asia (ASSET)](https://www.cirad.fr/en/cirad-news/news/2020/science/asset-sustainable-agrifood-systems-in-southeast-asia).
